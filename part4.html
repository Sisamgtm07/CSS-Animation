                Avengers: Infinity War ending might be tragic. You knew that
                some of Marvel’s greatest heroes were going to die. But you
                probably expected Captain America or Iron Man to bite the
                bullet. Instead, some of Marvel’s newly minted heroes like Black
                Panther and Spider-Man disappeared. It was a shocking twist, but
                the Marvel universe has been building up to this for nearly a
                decade.
